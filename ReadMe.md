# The Sink Plug

A part that can be created on a 3D printer to block the sink overflow on a bathroom sink
for aesthetic purposes.  This will reduce but not completely stop the flow of water.

Edit the SinkPlug.ipt part file to create a similar part.  The SinkPlug.stl file
can be used to directly create the part on a 3D printer.
